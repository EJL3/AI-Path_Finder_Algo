# Depth-first search (DFS)
An algorithm for navigating or searching through tree or graph data structures is called depth-first search (DFS). The algorithm begins at the root node (choosing an arbitrary node to serve as the root node in the case of a graph) and proceeds to investigate each branch as far as it can go before backtracking.

# Breadth-first search (BFS)
BFS is an algorithm for looking for nodes in a tree data structure that satisfy a specified property. Before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level, it begins at the root of the tree and investigates every node there.

# Greedy best-first search (GBFS)
The path that appears to be the best at the time is always chosen by the greedy best-first search algorithm. It combines methods for depth-first search and breadth-first search. It employs search and the heuristic function. We can benefit from both algorithms' advantages by using best-first search.

# A* algorithm
The shortest route between the starting point and the desired outcome is sought after by A* algorithm. It is utilised in many applications, including maps. The A* method is used in maps to determine the shortest path between the source (starting point) and the destination (final state).
